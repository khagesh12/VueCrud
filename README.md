# Laravel CRUD application useing Vue.js front-end library
* Run <code>composer install</code> to reinitialize entire Laravel application
* Then <code>php artisan key:generate</code> just to be sure that user's sessions are encrypted.
## Then you need to initialize frontend part
* Run <code>npm install</code> - this command will support the application with necessary NPM dependencies needed for Vue.js
* To compile frontend side just run <code>npm run dev</code>.
* At last run <code>php artisan serve</code> to run your Laravel application on localhost
### Enjoy!
